features

* if I decided against using the FB login I could offer that I just generate an email address that people connect with the craigslist offer
* directly post to craigslist (if possible)
* save email templates for searchers
  - this could also be solved by searchers having a profile with which they apply, but one of the key features is the *no signup effor* of the searchers
* on offer page, maybe allow up to 3 customizable questions
* auto login from all emails
* hide declined requests older then N minutes (or track that this has been seen)
* show declined button
* the renter should be able to initiate a conversation
  - maybe wants further information
  - searcher should not be able to do that to avoid spam
  - renter can set *allow direct contact*
  - when the renter invites the searcher to book a visit, automatically allow messaging
* when renter creates open house times, she can set `max_visitors`. This allows for open house like the shotwell people did
* allow to export the booked appointment into your calendar
* when all appointments are booked
  - send notification to renter that he maybe should create more slots
  - display *sorry message* to searcher
