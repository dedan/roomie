# who are my users?

## renters

painpoints are:

* hundreds of emails in inbox
* hard to keep track if searchers
* scheduling appointments is a hassle
* exact addresses have to be send
* event after the whole process, relieved that its over, they should email all the searchers they did not take


## searchers

painpoints are:

* send the same email over and over
* uncertainty of the status, although most of them might already be out of consideration
* hard to keep track of how many offers are still open
* don't hear back from renters, even when not taken
