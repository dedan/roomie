# Concept

A tool that simplifies the whole process around finding a roommate.

It is not a platform! This brings the very big advantage that I don't need a critical mass to make it work. It is very self contained and can grow naturally, starting with a small user base.

## man features, painpoints solved

* applicants get an immediate notification when they did not make it to the next level
* renters have a clear overview of all people who have applied, applicants don't get lost in the inbox
* renters can set available timeslots and invite applicants from their shortlist to book one of them
* when the renter made his decision all unlucky applicants get notified (currently you often never hear from them)

## growth/marketing

* This tool can be used in combination with other platforms.
* write to people offering on craigslist

## potential problems

* spam and fraud?
* what happens if you want to re-open the offer?
