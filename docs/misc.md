misc

* for us it would be of advantage to use FB login only
  * images
  * true person validation
  * less spam
* signup barrier for the searchers has to be as little as possible. Should be as easy as just sending an email
* not logged in searchers, allow them to associate the request with their FB profile
* finally closing the deal should maybe done in free form, not via `send offer` and `accept`
* feedback buttons everywhere
* logging and tracking active from the very beginning
* we probably need one more level of nesting because a renter might have several offers
